#  Tinder App Clone

This repository contains the full development of a transactional application inspired by Tinder, as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course at Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos√© de Caldas.

## üë• Authors

- Juli√°n Carvajal Garnica  
- Andr√©s Mauricio Cepeda Villanueva

## üß± Repository Structure

Each workshop represents a stage in the development process of the application. The structure is organized as follows:

## üìÅ Workshop-1/ 

- ([Workshop_1.pdf](https://github.com/Foulsito/TinderApp/tree/main/Workshop_1)): Requirements, user stories, CRC cards, and mockups 

## üìÅ Workshop_2/ 

- ([Workshop_2.pdf](https://github.com/Foulsito/TinderApp/tree/main/Workshop_2)): Conceptual design updates, UML diagrams, implementation plan for OOP concepts, and work-in-progress code 

## üìÅ Workshop_3/ 

- ([Workshop_3.pdf](https://github.com/Foulsito/TinderApp/tree/main/Workshop_3)): Final integration with simplified class structure, updated UML diagrams, photo and notification features, and functional code prototype

## üìÅ Workshop_4/ 

- ([Workshop_4.pdf](https://github.com/Foulsito/TinderApp/tree/main/Workshop_4)):  
  Final integration including **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and **file storage** for user persistence.  
  This stage consolidates all previous work into a fully interactive and persistent prototype.

## üìö Project Overview

We are building a simplified version of the Tinder dating app with the following features:

- User registration and authentication
- Profile setup (name, birthday, interests, lifestyle, photos)
- Interactions with other users (like, super like, dismiss)
- User safety tools (report/block functionality)

## üß© Workshops Summary

### üîπ Workshop 1 

> üìÅ Folder: `Workshop-1/`

Includes:
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Mockups ([View on Figma](https://www.figma.com/board/fnGljgUhbNpFASJmIpG6rC/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=pt9D6LsBvTT4PDfy-1)) 
- CRC cards for class planning

---

### üîπ Workshop 2 

> üìÅ Folder: `Workshop-2/`

Includes:
- Conceptual design updates
- UML class and sequence diagrams
- Application of OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, no polymorphism)
- Code snippets linked to the class structure

---

### üîπ Workshop 3 

> üìÅ Folder: `Workshop-3/`

Includes:
- Final class structure with `User`, `Photo`, `Notification`, and `App`
- Simplified features: profile editing, like notifications, and photo management
- Updated UML and activity diagrams
- Final code prototype reflecting OOP and SOLID principles

---

### üîπ Workshop 4 

> üìÅ Folder: `Workshop-4/`

Includes:
- Swing-based **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** with welcome, login, and registration screens  
- **File storage system** using `FileWriter` and `BufferedReader` to persist user data in `users.txt`  
- Updated **user stories** with acceptance criteria and development times  
- Enhanced **mockups** integrated into GUI design  
- **CRC cards** refined for final version (`User`, `Photo`, `Notification`, `App`)  
- Updated **UML class, sequence, and activity diagrams**  
- Application of OOP concepts (encapsulation and abstraction) and review of non-applied inheritance/polymorphism  
- Final **SOLID analysis**, showing extensibility for future features like a Match system  

This workshop delivers the **final integrated version** of the Tinder-inspired app, combining persistence, GUI, and modular code design into a testable and extensible application.
